# Week 6 — End-to-End Secure Communication Architecture

Secure communication emerges from **protocol integration**, not isolated features.

---

## 1. Device Communication Stack

A secure stack includes:
- Hardware identity
- Secure boot
- TLS-encrypted transport
- Protocol-level authentication

---

## 2. Cloud-Side Enforcement

Cloud systems must enforce:
- Device identity validation
- Topic or API authorization
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging

---

## 3. Fleet-Level Security

Design for:
- Credential rotation
- Device revocation
- Incident response

---

## Final Capstone

Design a secure communication architecture for:
- MQTT over TLS (Wi-Fi or Cellular)
- BLE provisioning + cloud handoff

Include:
- Authentication model
- Key handling
- Failure recovery

---

## Week 6 Takeaway

Communication security is successful only when **device, network, and cloud trust align**.
