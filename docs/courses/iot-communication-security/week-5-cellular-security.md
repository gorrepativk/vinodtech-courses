# Week 5 — Cellular IoT Security

Cellular connectivity provides **network-level security**, but it is not sufficient alone.

---

## 1. SIM-Based Security

Cellular networks authenticate devices using:
- SIM credentials
- Network authentication protocols

This protects **network access**, not application data.

---

## 2. Application-Layer Security

Even with cellular:
- TLS is required
- Server authentication is mandatory
- Data encryption is still necessary

---

## 3. Threats in Cellular IoT

- SIM cloning
- Backend credential leaks
- Rogue base stations

---

## Week 5 Takeaway

Cellular security complements — but does not replace — application-layer security.
